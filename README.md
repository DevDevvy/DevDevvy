<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Randall - Developer and Creative</h1>

[![TryHackMe Badge](https://tryhackme-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/m1ghtymax.png)](https://tryhackme.com/p/m1ghtymax)


Greetings! This is one of many repos I contribute to - though this is the only one that has been made public. 

## Professional Summary
Iâ€™m a Full Stack Platform Engineer and tech enthusiast with a deep passion for security, privacy, and ethical technology. My journey started in the music industry, where I honed creativity and pattern recognition over 15 years. Today, I channel that same creativity into software engineering, pentesting, and red teaming, focusing on secure, scalable solutions that make a real impact.

I hold a CompTIA Security+ (and working on more) certification and bring a strong foundation in secure system design. What sets me apart is my ability to combine analytical problem-solving with creative thinkingâ€”helping me spot vulnerabilities, engineer defenses, and deliver robust platforms that balance performance, security, and usability.

### Technical Expertise

Development & Engineering

Proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript, Golang, Python, HTML5, CSS3, and LLM-driven development

Experienced with React, Node.js, Django, Next.js for front- and back-end engineering

Skilled in cloud services & IaaS for scalable, reliable deployments

### Security & Privacy

Security+ Certified with practical focus on secure coding, network defense, and ethical hacking

Hands-on experience in pentesting, red teaming, and privacy-focused development

Advocate for digital safety and awareness, aiming to educate and protect future generations via my [Randy and the Techpocalypse](https://randallthomastech.com/techpocalypse) platform

### My Vision

Iâ€™m a systems thinker and lifelong learner, always exploring how technology, empathy, and creativity intersect. My mission is to design and defend systems that are not only technically excellent but also human-centeredâ€”building applications, platforms, and educational tools that advance security, privacy, and digital resilience.

**I have multiple other repos connected to me, so what you see here is only part of my work.**
