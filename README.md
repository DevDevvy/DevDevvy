<h3 align="center">How I Got Into Development</h3>

Shortly after graduating from Nashville Software School, I recieved contract work from Z Axis Solutions for full-stack MERN work on various websites. About a month later I was hired on full time to be a part of an application development team under contract with Z Axis Solutions. After two months on the team I was promoted to senior and lead backend for web. I am also a certified EngineerKit Level 1 mentor using the Transformational Coaching framework. I love solving complex problems and helping people realize their goals. I see both as the same function of breaking down problems into small manageable steps, and executing the first step.

<h3 align="center">My Plans As A Dev</h3>

My journey in life has been one of perpetual growth and learning. I see no reaon why that should ever stop- hence part of the reason why I chose to become a developer is to be immersed in an ever changing world of endless knowledge. My plans are to grow and develop my skills and knowledge as long as I breathe. I always keep in mind user experience and accessability. 

I love design and front-end work, but I am also highly analytical and curious which suits my full-stack endeavors. My work has had me working across the MERN stack mainly and I am looking for an opportunity to learn more languages, frameworks, and grow as a developer.

<h3 align="center">My Career As A Musician</h3>

My work can be heard in multiple languages as a background vocalist. As a lead singer, I have recorded in every genre from pop and classical to heavy metal and extreme vocals. I offer remote vocal services, songwriting, and consultation. As a freelance entrepreneur, I have worked with teams of people from across the world and am known for my timely and quality vocal work, as well as my creative writing skills.
