Thanks for dropping by, let me tell you a few things about myself...

<b>-----How I Got Into Development-----</b>

My life has consisted of interacting with complex ideas while utilizing highly sophisticated software and equipment. 

As a writer and musician, I have been self taught in many major DAW recording applications including ProTools, Ableton, Logic Pro, and various peripheral software applications. Because of these interactions using music, I have always been curious about what lies "behind the hood" in the applications I utilize every day. 

When my interest was piqued about development, it seemed I was getting the message from every side: Go to NSS bootcamp.

I was accepted into Nashville Software School, and have since February 2022 been a part of NSS full-stack, full-time web development course. This github repo is a testament to my growth and stands as a way to mark my own growth and learning. 

<b>------My Plans As A Dev------</b>

My journey in life has been one of perpetual growth and learning. I see no reaon why that should ever stop- hence part of the reason why I chose to become a developer is to be immersed in an ever changing world of endless knowledge. My plans are to grow and develop my skills and knowledge as long as I breathe. 

<b>----My Career As A Musician-----</b>

I have spent over 15 years as a session vocalist for studios from "Music Row" Nashville to Los Angeles. I have sang on, and written for clients that span from North America to China and have been recorded in multiple languages including Mandarin, French, and Spanish. 

My vocals range from classical ensemble tenor to screaming like a banshee. I have mastered a handful of singing techniquues including different types of metal screaming, and even Tuvan throat singing (Kargyraa "Mountain Style").

I am a soundbetter certified pro and offer vocals, song-writing, and music production.
