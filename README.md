<h3 align="center">How I Got Into Development</h3>

My life has consisted of interacting with complex ideas while utilizing highly sophisticated software and equipment. 

As a writer and musician, I have been self taught in many major DAW recording applications including ProTools, Ableton, Logic Pro, and various peripheral software applications. Because of these interactions using music, I have always been curious about what lies "behind the hood" in the applications I utilize every day. 

When my interest was piqued about development, it seemed I was getting the message from every side: Go to NSS bootcamp.

I was accepted into Nashville Software School, and have since February 2022 been a part of NSS full-stack, full-time web development course. This github repo is a testament to my growth and stands as a way to mark my own growth and learning. 

<h3 align="center">My Plans As A Dev</h3>

My journey in life has been one of perpetual growth and learning. I see no reaon why that should ever stop- hence part of the reason why I chose to become a developer is to be immersed in an ever changing world of endless knowledge. My plans are to grow and develop my skills and knowledge as long as I breathe. I always keep in mind user experience and accessability. 

I love design and front-end work, but I am also highly analytical and curious which suits my full-stack endeavors. 

<h3 align="center">My Career As A Musician</h3>

My work can be heard in multiple languages as a background vocalist. As a lead singer, I have recorded in every genre from pop and classical to heavy metal and extreme vocals. I offer remote vocal services, songwriting, and consultation. As a freelance entrepreneur, I have worked with teams of people from across the world and am known for my timely and quality vocal work, as well as my creative writing skills.
